## Hello!
I study computer science in an italian high school, and I am 17 years old.

- 🌱 Currently learning pure functional programming and operating systems.
- ☄️ I like having a deep understanding of how things work at a low level.
- 💡 Would love to collaborate to open source projects.

## Experience
I like to learn things from scratch and I tend to make projects with different technologies.

- 📄 Experience with different programming languages, such as:
  - C
  - Python
  - JavaScript
  - Elixir
